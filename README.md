# js_byte_tool
A tool for making a bunch of byte initializations in JavaScript easier.

# Purpose
I had to write a bunch of byte array initializations one day, and it became onerous. This tool was created to help make the process less error-prone.

# Usage
Coming soon. The project is in a rough state at the moment because I'm committing it as though I was still trying to make it a language feature, but that will soon change!
